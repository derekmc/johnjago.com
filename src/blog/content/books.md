As an avid reader, I've come across good books and bad books. Here are the ones which I believe have enough wisdom to be worth reading a second time.

## Nonfiction
- Meditations by Marcus Aurelius
- The Shallows by Nicholas Carr
- The Time Paradox by Philip Zimbardo
- Practical Typography by Matthew Butterick

## Fiction
- The Little Prince by Antoine de Saint-Exup√©ry
- Catch-22 by Joseph Heller
