Below are some blogs that I regularly read. You'll notice a common theme between all of them. Rather than just list them out, I have also included a few notable posts from each blog which exemplify the author's ideas and writing style.

## [Joel on Software](https://www.joelonsoftware.com/)
- [Things You Should Never Do, Part I](https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2000/04/06/things-you-should-never-do-part-i/)

> As any serious blog consumer can attest, a carefully curated blog feed, covering niches that matter to your life, can provide substantially more value than the collectivist ping-ponging of likes and memes that make up so much of social media interaction. <cite>Cal Newport</cite>
