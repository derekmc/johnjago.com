According to Wikipedia, I'm a "professional who invents, designs, analyzes, builds, and test machines, systems, structures, and materials to fulfill objectives and requirements while considering the limitations imposed by practicality, regulation, safety, and cost."

It just so happens that software is my machine.

I am interested in software that solves a problem as directly as possible with as little code as possible, a decentralized web, peer-to-peer networking, open source, and software that does not encroach upon people's privacy or time.
