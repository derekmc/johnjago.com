My name is John Jago. I am a backend developer who creates secure and efficient software systems, has an eye for [typography](https://practicaltypography.com/), and enjoys learning languages, both computer and human (你好, 我的中文名字是高彰!).

I graduated from Iowa State University but have no plans to stop learning.

I created this blog to share what I learn.
