Hi! I’m John Jago, a backend developer who enjoys learning languages of all
kinds. Currently, I use [Go](https://golang.org/) and [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
to build software products because they are practical, productive, and have
wonderful communities.

你好, 我的中文名字是高彰! 有朝一日，我想用中文写博文，可是现在我的中文不好。

In my spare time, I [read books](https://stack.app/u/john/books).
