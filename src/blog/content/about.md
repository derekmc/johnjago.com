This blog is a place for me to share what I learn about software. Much of what I learned came from others writing on blogs like this, so this is my attempt to give back to the community.

I am interested in software that solves a problem as directly as possible with as little code as possible. Other interests include open source, peer-to-peer networking, and [typography](https://practicaltypography.com/).

You can find my code on [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/johnjago) as well as [GitHub](https://github.com/johnjago).
