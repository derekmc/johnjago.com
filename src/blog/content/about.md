My name is John Jago. I am a backend developer with a passion for great products.
I have an eye for [typography](https://practicaltypography.com/) and enjoy
learning languages, both computer and human. 你好, 我的中文名字是高彰! 有朝一日，我想
用汉语写博文，可是现在我的汉语不好。

These days I use Go and TypeScript because they are practical, productive, have
wonderful communities, and cover the domain of problems that I'm interested in.

I graduated from Iowa State University but have no plans to stop learning.
