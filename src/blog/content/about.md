Hi! I’m John Jago, a backend developer who has an eye for [typography](https://practicaltypography.com/)
and enjoys learning languages of all kinds. Currently, I use
[Go](https://golang.org/) and [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
because they are practical, productive, and have wonderful communities.

你好, 我的中文名字是高彰! 有朝一日，我想用汉语写博文，可是现在我的汉语不好。

I graduated from Iowa State University.
