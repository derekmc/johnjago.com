This blog is a place for me to share what I learn about software. Much of what I learned came from others writing on blogs like this, so this is my attempt to give back to the community. Also, I often fix problems but don't keep any record of the solution, which leads me to searching the web trying to remember how I did it. By keeping notes here, this blog becomes a handy notebook that I can refer to in the future.

I am interested in software that solves a problem as directly as possible with as little code as possible, a decentralized web, peer-to-peer networking, open source, and software that does not encroach upon people's privacy or time.

You can find my code on [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/johnjago) as well as [GitHub](https://github.com/johnjago).
