My name is John Jago. I am a back-end developer and Linux enthusiast who loves [minimal software](https://suckless.org/) and [good typography](https://practicaltypography.com/).

I created this blog to share what I learn.

I'm not an overachiever; I prefer to [get things done](https://frankology.net/2018/11/15/the-overachiever-20/) and [stay uncomfortable](https://sivers.org/comfort) because that's where growth happens.
