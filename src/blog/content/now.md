## What I'm doing now

- Finishing my last semester at Iowa State University
- Making apps and libraries with Go, Clojure, and TypeScript, and learning a lot
  along the way
- [Reading books](https://stack.app/u/john/books)
- Slowly but surely working on [CodePing](https://codeping.me/)

Thanks to [Derek Sivers](https://sivers.org/now) for the idea of the "Now" page.
