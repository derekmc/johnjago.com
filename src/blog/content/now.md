## Exploring the world of startups

I'm working with a team on a real venture: making seamless checkout experiences. Our first product is for ecommerce â€” you can [check it out here](https://peachpay.app/). I've worked on side projects before, and I'm quickly finding out how much more there is to running a business than just making the software.

## Learning languages

I have been diving deep into Go and TypeScript, two modern languages that are a great fit for web projects, and looking for what the future will be built with. [V, maybe?](https://vlang.io/)

Why the interest in programming languages? Software is powerful leverage in today's world. Languages that enable people to build faster and better software will allow more people to contribute to new technology.

Oh, I'm also learning to read, write, and speak Mandarin Chinese!

## Reading books

Over the past **2 years** I've read **11 books** that have provided a lot of
value. I only keep track of the ones worth revisiting. See the list at
