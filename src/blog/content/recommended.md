Reading is one of the best ways to learn something new. However, not everything is worth reading. Below are some books, blogs, and other writings that I have found to be immensely valuable as a software developer.

## Books
- [The Architecture of Open Source Applications](http://aosabook.org/en/index.html)
- [The Cathedral and the Bazaar](http://www.unterstein.net/su/docs/CathBaz.pdf)

## Papers & Protocols

I am fascinated by the distributed architecture of peer-to-peer computer networks. While these concepts are not directly applicable to all fields of software development, the innovative thinking behind them certainly is.
