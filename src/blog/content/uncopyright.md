The below snippet is blatantly copied from Leo Babauta. Until I have the time to write something of my own, I have made the appropriate edits.

This entire blog, ~~and all my ebooks~~, are uncopyrighted ~~(since January 2008)~~.

That means I’ve put them in the public domain, and released my copyright on all these works.

There is no need to email me for permission — use my content however you want! Email it, share it, reprint it with or without credit. Change it around, put in a bunch of swear words and attribute them to me. It’s OK.

Attribution is appreciated but not required.

~~I’d prefer people buy my ebooks, but~~ if they want to share with friends, they have every right to do so.
